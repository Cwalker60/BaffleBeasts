BaffleBeasts is a mod about adding various creatures with a focus on mounts and tameable critters.
Currently have 3 mobs added with a plan to have more!

This mod uses Geckolib to help with the rendering and animations.

If there are any issues post them in issues and I'll see what I can do. This is my first mod
for Minecraft, so there may be some tom foolery in the code. Suggestions as well in issues is fine too.

Current plans are to support 1.20.1 to beyond on minecraft forge. There may be potential for fabric but the main focus is forge for now.
